# Task & Orchestration Core Contract Establishment Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Responsibility Boundary & Architectural Ownership
Workspace Management or the responsible infrastructure module provides a resolvable execution-runtime reference. Task & Orchestration consumes that reference to submit and monitor work. The Task & Orchestration module SHALL own Task and TaskWork domain models, Task creation/validation, canonical Task lifecycle, routing request representation, conversation/Task history, mock execution used for development and tests, provider-neutral execution contracts, consumer-side OpenClaw adapter, mapping platform requests to verified OpenClaw requests, mapping OpenClaw execution updates to normalized Task events, cancellation request forwarding, execution reference association, lifecycle projection, streaming/result/error/observability presentation, Task-scoped event isolation, and frontend rendering/interaction. The Task & Orchestration module SHALL NOT own OpenClaw installation, container creation, start/stop/restart/delete/upgrade, workspace provisioning, CPU/RAM allocation, Standard/Premium infrastructure configuration, Gateway DNS/networking, Gateway credential creation, platform-wide secret ownership, authentication implementation, workspace membership management, RBAC ownership, subscription validation implementation, payment, Agent Management, Workflow Management, Tool Management, Knowledge Base/RAG Management, custom orchestration engines, custom LLM routers, custom multi-agent collaboration engines, custom workflow runtimes, or OpenClaw internals.

#### Scenario: Verify architectural ownership boundaries
* **GIVEN** the Task & Orchestration module is initialized
* **WHEN** the system interacts with external dependencies or execution runtimes
* **THEN** it SHALL consume externally supplied runtime references provided by Workspace Management or infrastructure modules
* **AND** it SHALL NOT provision OpenClaw instances, manage containers, or administer external module domains

---

### Requirement: External Dependency Contracts & Prerequisites
A usable execution-runtime reference must be supplied by Workspace Management or the responsible infrastructure module before real execution can begin. The Task & Orchestration specifications SHALL define consumer-facing ports conceptually without claiming ownership of their implementations:
```ts
interface WorkspaceExecutionRuntimeResolver {
  resolve(workspaceId: WorkspaceId): Promise<WorkspaceExecutionRuntime>;
}

interface WorkspaceExecutionRuntime {
  provider: "openclaw";
  instanceId: string;
  endpointReference: string;
  credentialReference: string;
  status: "running" | "stopped" | "unavailable";
}
```
External dependencies SHALL be defined conceptually for Agent Management (workspace-scoped selectable agents, platform-agent to provider-agent mapping), Workflow Management (workspace-scoped selectable workflows, platform-workflow to provider-workflow mapping), Workspace User Management / Authentication (authorized principal and operation permission), and Workspace Management (resolvable execution-runtime reference).

#### Scenario: Consume external dependency contracts
* **GIVEN** a task execution or routing selection is initiated
* **WHEN** Task & Orchestration interacts with external modules
* **THEN** it SHALL consume conceptual ports for Agent Management, Workflow Management, Authentication, and Workspace Management
* **AND** it SHALL NOT implement or administer those external modules

---

### Requirement: Cross-Change Dependency Order
The cross-change dependency order SHALL be documented and adhered to as follows:
```text
enhance-task-orchestration-production-ui
    independent presentation alignment

establish-openclaw-task-integration-contracts
    defines consumer-side contracts

integrate-openclaw-task-execution
    depends on integration contracts
    and on an externally supplied runtime prerequisite

extend-openclaw-execution-observability
    depends on task execution integration
```

#### Scenario: Enforce cross-change dependency order
* **GIVEN** the multi-change implementation roadmap
* **WHEN** changes are implemented or validated
* **THEN** `establish-openclaw-task-integration-contracts` SHALL define consumer-side contracts
* **AND** subsequent changes SHALL respect the defined contract and runtime prerequisite hierarchy
